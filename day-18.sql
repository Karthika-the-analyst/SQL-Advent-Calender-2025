-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

WITH scores AS (
    SELECT
        subject,
        FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (
            PARTITION BY subject
            ORDER BY quiz_date
        ) AS first_score,
        LAST_VALUE(score) OVER (
            PARTITION BY subject
            ORDER BY quiz_date
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
        ) AS last_score
    FROM daily_quiz_scores
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    subject,
    first_score,
    last_score,
    last_score - first_score AS improvement
FROM scores;
